According to this mini project, I want to share with learner and all people :  _how it's possible to make airflow interact with minio instance._
Principally interaction between airflow and minio or s3 instance can be effective using :
#### > S3Hook instances
#### > Amazon providers transferts class
#### > Amazon providers Operators class
#### > Amazon providers Sensor class


Minio or S3 instances a nowadays some of technologies more use on the Data Engineering domain for : 
- For storing ELT result on data pipeline
- For medaillon architecture too
- Using as datalakehouse with table format technologies like apache iceberg, hive, etc...
